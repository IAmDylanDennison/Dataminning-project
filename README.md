Prediction of Diabetes in Women

Diabetes is a prevalent disease in the U.S. today
According to the CDC, as of 2018, approximately 10.5% of the U.S. population has diabetes

Since Diabetes is so widespread (approximately 34.2 Americans), being able to properly identify the disease is crucial
CDC also states that “7.3 million adults aged 18 years or older who met laboratory criteria for diabetes were not aware of or did not report having diabetes 
(undiagnosed diabetes, Table 1b). This number represents 2.8% of all US adults (Table 1a) and 21.4% of all US adults with diabetes.”

Using Tkinter, we created a GUI that allows users to predict the diabetes outcome of females.
User uploads a .csv file with the varibles 
Number of Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI (Body Mass Index), Diabetes Pedigree Function, and Age

Used scikit learn regression tree and mathpotlib for visual representation.
